## Acknowledgements
This extension originates from the [original extension](https://www.raycast.com/mathieudutour/wolfram-alpha)
available in the Raycast Store. As the original extension was not working, I decided to fork it and make it work again.
I've also updated the codebase to use more modern APIs.
